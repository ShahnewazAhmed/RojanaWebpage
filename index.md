## Overview of My Research

### Current Work

I am currently working on a research project with [Dr. Toffazal Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tofazzal_Islam), ..................

### **Blast Resistance in Wheat**
I have dedicated significant efforts to developing wheat varieties resistant to blast disease. My master’s thesis focused on integrating the *Rmg8* resistance gene from winter wheat (genotype S-615) into the Bangladeshi spring wheat variety BARI Gom 33. Through bioassays and marker-assisted screening, I successfully developed resistant lines, making it the first deployment of *Rmg8*-integrated wheat in Bangladesh. This project was funded by the Research Management Wing (RMW) at BSMRAU, where I served as the Principal Investigator.

### **Pathogen Management and Bioactive Compounds**
As a Research Assistant in Dr. Tofazzal Islam’s team, I worked on isolating and characterizing fungal pathogens, including *Magnaporthe oryzae Triticum* (MoT) and *Bipolaris sorokiniana*. I also explored bacterial bioactive compounds as sustainable solutions for managing fungal diseases.

### **Mutation Breeding for Blast Resistance**
I contributed to a mutation breeding project, where we screened M4-generation wheat for blast resistance, identifying robust mutant populations resistant to disease.

Both genes recognize the AVR-<i>Rm8</i> gene ofthe wheat blast fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzaepathotype Triticum</i> (MoT), which resultsin resistance against this pathogen.

            Wheat blast caused by a filamentous fungus <i>Magnaportha oryzae Triticum</i> (MoT) has emerged as a potential pandemic threat to global food security. Control of this fungus by chemical fungicides are unreliable due to its quick evolution and development of resistance against the chemicals. The development of a resistant variety is an effective way to combat the destructive fungal pathogen. Ten wheat blast resistance genes are discovered. Among them, seven genes namely, <i>Rmg1-7</i> are ineffective at higher temperatures. The blast resistance gene, <i>2NS</i> translocation has been deployed in the field of South America and Bangladesh. This study for the first-time evaluated blast-resistant performances of the genotypes <i>S615</i>, <i>GR119</i>, and wheat variety BARI Gom 33 that carry blast-resistance genes, <i>Rmg8</i>, <i>RmgGR119</i>, and <i>2NS</i> translocation, respectively in the field conditions, where BARI Gom 26 was used as a susceptible variety. Wheat genotypes/varieties carrying all three genes showed significantly higher but varying levels of blast resistance compared to BARI Gom 26. These results suggest that stacking of these genes in the elite varieties is needed to develop durable blast-resistant wheat varieties under the changing climate scenario in Bangladesh and beyond. Functional analysis of these genes is needed to elucidate the molecular mechanism of resistance under varying environmental conditions.

        <summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
        Wheat is one of the most important crops for global food security. <i>Magnaportha oryzae Triticum</i>, a filamentous fungus that causes wheat blast, has emerged as a potentially catastrophic food security threat in some countries in South America, Africa, and Asia, such as Bangladesh. Developing blast-resistant varieties is considered a long-term solution to this problem. There are limited sources of blast resistance, and no completely blast-resistant variety is available. To mitigate wheat blast, two blast resistance genes, <i>Rmg8</i> and <i>2NS</i> translocation, are thought to be promising candidates for stacking into commercially cultivated varieties. A <i>2NS</i> translocation in BARI Gom-33 has shown some tolerance to wheat blast. This study aimed to develop a durable blast-resistant variety by introducing <i>Rmg8</i> from genotype <i>S615</i> into BARI Gom-33. Eighty F1 seeds of introgressed plants were germinated and sown as individual lines to produce F2 segregating plants. Bioassay-guided and marker-based screening resulted in 11 blast-resistant F2 plants. A further evaluation of these 11 lines containing two resistance genes was carried out in the field for their blast resistance and yield. After bioassay and marker-assisted selection, we obtained 16 plants carrying both resistance genes, <i>Rmg8</i> and <i>2NS</i> translocation. The newly selected lines are resistant to blast as well as showed good agronomic characteristics. Selfing of the F4 population would result in promising lines carrying both genes along with superior agronomic characteristics that would be useful for the development of a durable blast-resistant wheat variety to combat the wheat blast disease in Bangladesh.

        <summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
        Wheat is an important crop for world food security and also for Bangladesh. Recently, a fungal disease, wheat blast, caused by a filamentous fungus <i>Magnaporthe oryzae Triticum</i> has emerged as a destructive disease of wheat, which poses serious threat to food security in many countries including Bangladesh. Breeding for blast-resistant varieties must be a long-term solution to this fungus. Among the blast resistance genes discovered, two genes, <i>Rmg8</i> and <i>2NS</i> translocation are thought to be promising candidates to be introgressed into the commercially cultivated variety for the mitigation of wheat blast. BARI GOM-33 carrying a 2NS translocation has shown moderate tolerance to the wheat blast disease. The aim of this study was to introgress Rmg8 gene from genotype S615 into the BARI Gom-33 for the development of a durable blast resistant variety. After successful crossing, 61 F1 seeds from introgressed lines were sown in a field and harvested to obtain F2 segregating generation. Marker-based and bioassay-guided screening of F2 plants resulted in 11 blast resistant plants along with good agronomic characteristics. The lines carrying two resistant genes are ready to be evaluated again in the field for their blast resistance and yield. It is expected that segregating F3 generation would provide more stable lines carrying both genes along with superior agronomic characteristics that would be utilized for the development of blast resistant wheat variety.
